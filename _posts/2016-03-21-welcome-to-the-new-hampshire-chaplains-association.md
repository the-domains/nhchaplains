Welcome to the New Hampshire Chaplains Association!

We are an informal collegial association of chaplains in New Hampshire.   For over 20 years we've existed as a place for mutual support and encouragement, networking, and a forum to exchange resources and ideas.  Chaplains who are part of this community serve in a variety of contexts including hospitals, prisons, hospices, and the workplace.

We meet quarterly, and the meeting location rotates around a variety of locations in NH.  Each meeting features a speaker, and time for networking and informal conversation.  If you are a professional or volunteer chaplain living or working in NH, we welcome your interest and participation.

To be included in our **mail list**, you can subscribe yourself [here][0], or to unsubscribe click [here][1].
