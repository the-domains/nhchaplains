**Male Nurse Washing a Nun by Geoffrey Bowe, Kent, England**

Today

he had washed a nun.

She didn't seem to mind

because he was doing his job.

Her body

looked pale and unused,

her nipples

like the pile of stones

found at the summit of mountains.

He talked to her

about _T__he Sound of Music_

as he washed her thighs.

"I know all the songs," she said.

He asked her to roll over

so that he could wash her back and bottom

as they discussed Mother Theresa.

For ten minutes

the sponge licked at her body

as ray of light

entered like an angel

through the gap in her curtains,

illuminating the bed and its contents.

The male nurse noticed

how the pattern on the curtains

looked like stained glass,

her bedside table like an altar.

He found himself kneeling

down, beside the bed,

before pulling himself together

and leaving.
