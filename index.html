(.Darrell Halen Photo) New Boston veteran helps others find final peace By Darrell Halen David Teed spends a lot of his time with veterans. He visits nursing homes, veterans organizations, assisted-living facilities and other places, and likes to let veterans know of the programs and benefits that are available to them. Teed, a Navy veteran who lives in New Boston, also tells them about the company he works for – Compassionate Care Hospice, which provides home health care, palliative care and hospice care – a service provided to the terminally ill and their loved ones to ease the emotional and physical trauma associated with the end of life. "Some people are only with us a very short time," said Teed, who works in the company's Londonderry office as its veterans' liaison. "In my (time) of getting to meet them, I don't really learn about them or their families. Others I've worked with for months and I get to know their kids, their grand-kids and we share stories, and I watch them steadily decline, ultimately depart." In addition to New Hampshire, Compassionate Care Hospice is located in 21 other states. Staffers in the Londonderry office, which includes nurses, social workers and others, deal with patients who are spending the end of their lives at homes, hospitals, nursing homes and other places. Hospice patients are suffering from cancer, renal failure, dementia, a heart condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or another ailment. The company's hospice services are available to all people, including veterans. When a patient is going into hospice care, a clinical liaison at the office will gather information about the patient and submit forms, and then other employees get involved. "A lot of times when you talk to veterans, especially your World War II, Korean and Vietnam-era veterans, they internalize a lot of stuff," Teed said. "They won't talk to civilian people. They'll say, 'Yeah, I was in the service' and that's all you'll get out of them. What we find with the older veterans is, as they become more in touch with their mortality, they have a lot of repressed anger, grief or regrets, and they take it out on their family or the caregivers at the nursing homes, and the people don't know why. What we found is that by me talking to them, I'm able to have that fellow veteran-to-veteran conversation." For a veteran in hospice care, the company will present a certificate honoring them for their service, along with two small flags – a U.S. flag and a flag of their military branch. For some veterans, it's a way to see some family members for the last time. "Every family's different," Teed said. "We've had some where we've had full-blown parties, cake and everything else. We've had others that have been very somber occasions by the bedside where we read it and everyone is very quiet." </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="72"><p><b>Susan Walker, a Manchester resident, is one of two chaplains for the New Hampshire office. She holds a master of divinity degree from Methodist Theological School in Ohio, and received clinical pastoral education at Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, Mass. Their work, she said, is to provide a holistic experience for patients, families and staff. Chaplains support patients of all faiths, try to ?bring more life to their days,? lift their spirits and determine what fills them spiritually. "We try to add as many spiritual connections that are important for them," said Walker, who reaches out to churches, mosques and other places of worship for rituals to be fulfilled. "A lot of times for chaplains, it's companionship, just being there to listen. There may be some personal things they need to talk about, maybe some things that happened over the years they aren't able to talk about with other people, and just being able to let those things go. I think forgiveness is a big part of our spiritual path. Not necessarily for the other person, but being able to let things go and (have) forgiveness in our hearts." Some of the loved ones of patients whom hospice workers deal with are at times in tears and stressed out. "It's a whole gamut of emotions," Walker said. "We have to accept them where they are (emotionally), give them as much comfort and care as we can." </b></p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="73"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="74"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="75"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="76"><span data-reactid="77"><!-- react-empty: 78 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="79"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="80">The New Hampshire Chaplains Association</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="81"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="82"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="83"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

She holds a master of divinity degree from Methodist Theological School in Ohio, and received clinical pastoral education at Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, Mass. Their work, she said, is to provide a holistic experience for patients, families and staff. Chaplains support patients of all faiths, try to ?bring more life to their days,? lift their spirits and determine what fills them spiritually. \"We try to add as many spiritual connections that are important for them,\" said Walker, who reaches out to churches, mosques and other places of worship for rituals to be fulfilled. \"A lot of times for chaplains, it's companionship, just being there to listen. There may be some personal things they need to talk about, maybe some things that happened over the years they aren't able to talk about with other people, and just being able to let those things go. I think forgiveness is a big part of our spiritual path. Not necessarily for the other person, but being able to let things go and (have) forgiveness in our hearts.\" Some of the loved ones of patients whom hospice workers deal with are at times in tears and stressed out. \"It's a whole gamut of emotions,\" Walker said. \"We have to accept them where they are (emotionally), give them as much comfort and care as we can.\"
